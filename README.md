# Licenses

This is a repository for custom software and intellectual property licenses that I have created.

The LICENSE.md and STANDARDSBLACKLIST.md at the root are the original versions of my Petty Software license, and I retain all rights over the licenses themselves.

Future iterations will be uploaded into their own folders to prevent confusion, and when given a specific version designation they will not be modified in the future.
The rolling folders is subject to change at any time, however.
