1. Reproduce and distribute the Licensed Software, in whole or in part; and
2. Produce, reproduce, and distribute Adapted Software.

## Other Rights

1. **Rights Not Licensed**: Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this license, nor are publicity, privacy, patent, trademark, and/or other similar personality or intellectual property rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. **Royalty Waiver**: To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

## License Conditions

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions:

### 1. Blacklist Restriction
You are permitted to use, modify, and redistribute this Licensed Software for any purpose, provided that:
1. You are not listed on Standard's Blacklist as maintained by Standard;
2. You comply with all other conditions of this license.

### 2. Attribution
If You distribute the Licensed Software (including in modified form), You must:

**Required Attribution Elements:**
1. Retain the following if supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Software:
   1. Identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Software and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
   2. A copyright notice;
   3. Aa notice that refers to this license;
   4. A notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
   5. A a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Software to the extent reasonably practicable;

3. Indicate the Licensed Software is licensed under this license. Include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this license.

**Attribution Flexibility:**
You may satisfy the attribution conditions in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You distribute the Licensed Software. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

**Attribution Removal:**
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the required attribution information to the extent reasonably practicable.

### 3. ShareAlike
If You distribute Adapted Software that You produce, the following conditions also apply:
1. The license You apply to Your Adapted Software must be this same license;
2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this license;
3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Software that restrict exercise of the rights granted under this license.

**Permission Request Mechanism:**
If You wish to incorporate parts of the Licensed Software into other works whose license conditions are different, write to the Licensor to ask for permission. Standard may make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by preserving user freedoms in derivative works and promoting software sharing generally.

### 4. Technical Modifications
The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights. This includes technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures when legally permitted.

### 5. Downstream Recipients
1. Every recipient of the Licensed Software automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this license, unless the recipient is listed on Standard’s Blacklist;
2. Every recipient of Adapted Software from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Software under the conditions of this license;
3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Software if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Software.

### 6. No Endorsement
Nothing in this license constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Software is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution.

## Section 7: Source Code Distribution Requirements

When You distribute the Licensed Software in executable or binary form, You must fulfill one of the following requirements:

### Option A: Bundled Source Distribution
Accompany the executable with the complete Source Form on the same physical or electronic medium typically used for software distribution.

### Option B: Written Source Offer
Accompany the executable with a written commitment, valid for no less than three (3) years, stating that You will provide any recipient with a complete copy of the Source Form for a fee not exceeding Your reasonable cost of physical distribution media and delivery.

### Option C: Offer Pass-Through
If You received the executable with a written source offer conforming to Option B, You may accompany Your distribution with the identical offer You received, provided Your distribution is non-commercial.

### Source Form Requirements
The Source Form must include all components necessary for a recipient to:
1. Understand the software's functionality
2. Modify the software
3. Compile or generate the executable form
4. Install and run the resulting software

**System Component Exception:**
As a special exception, the Source Form need not include anything normally distributed with major system components (compiler, kernel, standard libraries, and so on) unless that component itself accompanies the Licensed Software.

### Delivery Methods
Source Form may be provided through any reasonable method, including physical media, network download, or access to a source repository, provided the method remains accessible for the duration of any written offer period.

## Section 8: Legal Conflict Resolution

### Conflicting Obligations
If external circumstances impose conditions upon You that contradict any provision of this license—whether through court judgment, patent restrictions, government regulations, contractual obligations, or any other cause—reasonable effort must be taken such that these circumstances do not inhibit compliance  with this license.

### Distribution Prohibition
In circumstances where You cannot simultaneously satisfy both this license and conflicting external obligations, You must cease all distribution and sublicensing of the Licensed Software until such conflicts are resolved.

### Scope Limitation
This restriction applies solely to distribution and sublicensing activities. Your right to use the Licensed Software for personal purposes should remains unaffected by external conflicts that prevent distribution.

## Section 9: Work Scope and Boundaries

### Coverage Determination
This license applies to the Licensed Software and any Derivative Work. This license does not extend to:

1. **Independent Works**: Software developed without reference to, knowledge of, or use of the Licensed Software
2. **Mere Distribution**: Placing the Licensed Software on storage media alongside unrelated software without functional integration
3. **Communication Interfaces**: Software that communicates with the Licensed Software through standardized protocols, APIs, or data formats, provided such communication does not require incorporating Licensed Software code

### Integration Test
Software that requires embedding, linking, or incorporating portions of the Licensed Software to function properly shall be considered a Derivative Work subject to this license.

### Aggregation Exception
Collections of independent software distributed together solely for convenience do not become Derivative Works merely through such packaging, provided each work can function independently and no unified installation or operation procedure is required.

## Section 10: License Versions

Each version of this license has a distinguishing version number. If the Licensed Software specifies "Standard's Petty Software License [version] or any later version," You may choose to follow either that version or any later version published by Standard.

## Standard's Blacklist

Individuals or entities on Standard's Blacklist are strictly prohibited from using, modifying, distributing, or engaging with this Licensed Software.

## Penalties for License Violations

The maximum penalty allowable by law, including actual damages, and statutory damages for copyright infringement.
### Inflation Adjustment
The net worth threshold is adjusted annually based on the annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) as published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.

## Other Terms and Conditions

1. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed to by Licensor;
2. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Software not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this license.

## Interpretation and Severability

### General Interpretation
1. For the avoidance of doubt, this license does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Software that could lawfully be made without permission under this license;
2. No term or condition of this license will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor;
3. Nothing in this license constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

### Severability Provisions
1. **General Severability**: To the extent possible, if any provision of this license is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this license without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
2. **Blacklist Severability**: If any provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect. Invalid provisions will be modified to be valid and enforceable. If any part of Standard's Blacklist is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect. The licensing restrictions will continue to apply to all other individuals or entities listed therein.
3. **Partial Invalidity**: The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this license shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any provision is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable provision.

## Representations and Warranties

THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS LICENSED SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
# Indemnification
This section only applies to the extent allowed by the applicable laws of your jurisdiction. If the applicable laws of your jurisdiction do not allow you to enter into the indemnification obligation below, then you assume, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws of your jurisdiction, all liabilities, damages, judgements, awards, losses, costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) that are the stated subject matter of the indemnification obligation below.

You agree to indemnify, pay the defense cost of, and hold harmless Standard from and against all liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) arising out of or in connection with any third-party claims, demands, or actions (i) that, if true, would involve a breach by you of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any distribution or sublicensing of the Licensed Technology in violation of this Agreement), or (ii) related to your Products or your exercise of the License (except to the extent the third party is alleging your authorized use of unmodified Licensed Technology originally provided to you by Standard under this Agreement infringes any patent, trademark, or copyright).

# Governing Law and Jurisdiction
Any dispute or claim by you arising out of or related to this Agreement will be governed by New York law, exclusive of its choice of law rules. You and Standard agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New York County, New York, or, if federal court jurisdiction exists, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. You and Standard agree to waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts (without affecting either party’s rights to remove a case to federal court if permissible), as well as any right to a jury trial. The Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract will be construed against the drafter will not apply to this Agreement. This paragraph will be interpreted as broadly as applicable law permits.
